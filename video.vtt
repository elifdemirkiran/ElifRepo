WEBVTT - 2014 Three Minute Thesis winning presentation by Emily Johnston

1
0:00:00 --> 0:00:04.920000
So welcome all.

2
0:00:04.920000 --> 0:00:05.920000
Thank you for coming.

3
0:00:05.920000 --> 0:00:09.360000
My name is Naomi Black and I'm a member of the Accessibility Engineering Group here at

4
0:00:09.360000 --> 0:00:10.360000
Google.

5
0:00:10.360000 --> 0:00:14.800000
And today I'm very pleased to invite our speaker, Dr. Sylvia Fyfer.

6
0:00:14.800000 --> 0:00:21.360000
Sylvia is a member and an invited expert on the W3C HTML Accessibility Task Force.

7
0:00:21.360000 --> 0:00:25.360000
And she's also the author of the Definitive Guide to HTML5 video.

8
0:00:25.360000 --> 0:00:27.360000
So Sylvia's here to talk to us.

9
0:00:27.360000 --> 0:00:28.360000
Come on up.

10
0:00:28.360000 --> 0:00:32.920000
Sylvia's here to talk to us today about WebVTT, which is one of the standards for time text,

11
0:00:32.920000 --> 0:00:35.400000
which is under consideration by the W3C.

12
0:00:35.400000 --> 0:00:36.480000
Thank you, Sylvia.

13
0:00:36.480000 --> 0:00:38.720000
Thank you.

14
0:00:38.720000 --> 0:00:42.960000
Thanks for inviting me to come and speak about this important topic today.

15
0:00:42.960000 --> 0:00:48.960000
We know there are a lot of discussions going on about formats for captions and we want

16
0:00:48.960000 --> 0:00:51.680000
to standardize them for the web.

17
0:00:51.680000 --> 0:00:55.440000
But standardizing it for the web has a much larger impact these days than just on web

18
0:00:55.440000 --> 0:00:56.520000
browsers.

19
0:00:56.520000 --> 0:00:59.280000
Just on the web itself, it goes into many different devices.

20
0:00:59.280000 --> 0:01:04.960000
So we're very interested and very keen to give a broad coverage of available technology.

21
0:01:04.960000 --> 0:01:07.560000
And this is what we're trying to do here today.

22
0:01:07.560000 --> 0:01:14.280000
So I'll be talking about mostly WebVTT, the file format.

23
0:01:14.280000 --> 0:01:18.560000
But I'll also be talking a little bit about how to plug that into the web browser, into

24
0:01:19.560000 --> 0:01:27.200000
HTML, so that in the future we have a very simple way of displaying captions in web browsers

25
0:01:27.200000 --> 0:01:33.280000
on videos without having to do much more than authoring a file and giving a link to the

26
0:01:33.280000 --> 0:01:36.160000
web browser for that file.

27
0:01:36.160000 --> 0:01:40.280000
So it will be very simple for people in the future to create more captions.

28
0:01:40.280000 --> 0:01:42.240000
All right.

29
0:01:42.240000 --> 0:01:48.720000
So this dig right in, as we were looking at requirements of a such a text format, a

30
0:01:48.720000 --> 0:01:55.760000
web text format for video, we looked at the different types of content that can be time

31
0:01:55.760000 --> 0:01:58.360000
aligned with video.

32
0:01:58.360000 --> 0:02:00.960000
And captions and subtitles are the obvious ones.

33
0:02:00.960000 --> 0:02:05.120000
But text video descriptions are also an important use.

34
0:02:05.120000 --> 0:02:11.720000
These are for blind users and can be read out by screen readers in parallel to the playback

35
0:02:11.720000 --> 0:02:13.120000
of the video.

36
0:02:13.120000 --> 0:02:19.960000
This may well not be the most usable way of doing audio descriptions, but it is a much

37
0:02:19.960000 --> 0:02:24.880000
easier way to publish audio descriptions for blind users.

38
0:02:24.880000 --> 0:02:29.200000
And in fact, for a lot of blind users, it may well be all they need because they already

39
0:02:29.200000 --> 0:02:34.720000
have their screen reader set up and it works really well for some people.

40
0:02:34.720000 --> 0:02:40.080000
Further to that, we are also talking about navigation or chapters, which is also very

41
0:02:40.080000 --> 0:02:43.280000
important for blind.

42
0:02:43.280000 --> 0:02:47.720000
And in fact, any user, if you want to go through a video quickly and find out what's

43
0:02:47.720000 --> 0:02:53.680000
in there, you want to jump to what we now know as chapter markers, we can call them

44
0:02:53.680000 --> 0:02:55.640000
navigation markers.

45
0:02:55.640000 --> 0:02:59.800000
This can be also covered with the same kind of format.

46
0:02:59.800000 --> 0:03:05.560000
And more generally metadata, this is something that archives are particularly interested

47
0:03:05.560000 --> 0:03:09.720000
in to attach metadata to sections in the video.

48
0:03:09.720000 --> 0:03:13.600000
Can also be done with such a time aligned text format.

49
0:03:13.600000 --> 0:03:18.440000
So what we have discussed for browsers is a very simple format.

50
0:03:18.440000 --> 0:03:22.520000
It's called Web VTT, video text tracks.

51
0:03:22.520000 --> 0:03:29.320000
Web VTT, this is one of the very simple files that we can think about, just a marker at

52
0:03:29.320000 --> 0:03:33.840000
the beginning of the file that identifies the file format.

53
0:03:33.840000 --> 0:03:38.640000
The captions or subtitles, let's call them Qs.

54
0:03:38.640000 --> 0:03:41.400000
Then have an individual identifier.

55
0:03:41.400000 --> 0:03:44.920000
In this case, it's the number one and number two.

56
0:03:44.920000 --> 0:03:46.720000
Could be any string, however.

57
0:03:46.720000 --> 0:03:52
And then we've got start times and end times on each one of these Qs and a piece of text

58
0:03:52 --> 0:03:53.720000
in there.

59
0:03:53.720000 --> 0:04:00.640000
It turns out then, as we all know, how captions are displayed on screen in something like

60
0:04:00.640000 --> 0:04:07.120000
this, if it's automatically created by the browser.

61
0:04:07.120000 --> 0:04:11.040000
That was the very simplest way of doing subtitles.

62
0:04:11.040000 --> 0:04:16.480000
Now we want to do more than just the simple captions, in particular if we want to achieve

63
0:04:16.480000 --> 0:04:22.120000
all the functionality of, for example, the CEA 608 captions, then we need to do a bit

64
0:04:22.160000 --> 0:04:23.760000
more than just text.

65
0:04:23.760000 --> 0:04:25.920000
We also want to have some formatting in there.

66
0:04:25.920000 --> 0:04:30.240000
Here is an example on how to do bold.

67
0:04:30.240000 --> 0:04:32.800000
I'll point to it.

68
0:04:32.800000 --> 0:04:37.320000
There's a bold tag in here, so that will be bold text.

69
0:04:37.320000 --> 0:04:39.760000
Here is some italic text.

70
0:04:39.760000 --> 0:04:48.520000
And up here, we've got a general way to associate style or a class to a piece of text and give

71
0:04:48.520000 --> 0:04:49.520000
it a meaning.

72
0:04:49.520000 --> 0:04:59.280000
In this situation, we've turned a piece of text into red text and capitalized it.

73
0:04:59.280000 --> 0:05:05.640000
Of course, if we're using this format also for subtitles, we need to be careful to cover

74
0:05:05.640000 --> 0:05:07.800000
internationalization issues.

75
0:05:07.800000 --> 0:05:10.120000
Web VTT is very clear here.

76
0:05:10.120000 --> 0:05:13.760000
It requires UTF-8 character encoding.

77
0:05:13.760000 --> 0:05:20.760000
It has a Ruby tag, which supports Asian languages in particular.

78
0:05:20.760000 --> 0:05:25.680000
It also does vertical and horizontal rendering of text.

79
0:05:25.680000 --> 0:05:30.640000
Again, possibly one of the most important ones are Asian languages.

80
0:05:30.640000 --> 0:05:35.600000
And I think there are a few other languages that are also rendered vertically.

81
0:05:35.600000 --> 0:05:38.960000
And we need to make sure we get the alignment right.

82
0:05:39.960000 --> 0:05:45.200000
And the text is red from the right to the left, so therefore it needs to be aligned on

83
0:05:45.200000 --> 0:05:51.360000
the right rather than on the left.

84
0:05:51.360000 --> 0:05:54.640000
Now positioning is another requirement.

85
0:05:54.640000 --> 0:06:01.160000
Again, something that traditional captions, TV captions, are able to do.

86
0:06:01.160000 --> 0:06:06.440000
It's possible to position cues anywhere in VTT.

87
0:06:06.440000 --> 0:06:10.880000
There are basically three important ways to position text.

88
0:06:10.880000 --> 0:06:12.840000
There are line positions.

89
0:06:12.840000 --> 0:06:19.280000
So the concept of display lines exists in Web VTT.

90
0:06:19.280000 --> 0:06:25.760000
So the line position allows people to directly address a specific line.

91
0:06:25.760000 --> 0:06:31.760000
It's also, it can be done with a line number or a percentage.

92
0:06:31.760000 --> 0:06:34.720000
Then we have the text position.

93
0:06:34.720000 --> 0:06:41.080000
This means we're placing the text either on the left and the middle or on the right.

94
0:06:41.080000 --> 0:06:44.960000
No, hold on, that's the alignment, sorry.

95
0:06:44.960000 --> 0:06:46.800000
Alignment is left, middle and right.

96
0:06:46.800000 --> 0:06:56.400000
And the text position is, so when we have text like this, it's in the middle and it's

97
0:06:56.400000 --> 0:06:57.400000
centered.

98
0:06:57.400000 --> 0:07:05.760000
So we can also do a centering and we can do a left alignment and the right alignment,

99
0:07:05.760000 --> 0:07:09.120000
but we can also move that whole text elsewhere.

100
0:07:09.120000 --> 0:07:12.920000
So the text position is where we move the text and the alignment is where we align it

101
0:07:12.920000 --> 0:07:14.720000
at.

102
0:07:14.720000 --> 0:07:18.120000
Sorry for the confusion.

103
0:07:18.120000 --> 0:07:23.880000
We also have speaker semantics included into Web VTT, which is interesting because it allows

104
0:07:23.960000 --> 0:07:27.720000
us to put some semantic information into our markup.

105
0:07:27.720000 --> 0:07:30.680000
Here for example, we have two people speaking.

106
0:07:30.680000 --> 0:07:35
We know they're positioned on the left and on the right.

107
0:07:35 --> 0:07:43.440000
And the speaker markup can tell us where we want to position it and can also, for example,

108
0:07:43.440000 --> 0:07:47.840000
help us always use the same styling for the same speaker.

109
0:07:47.840000 --> 0:07:53.560000
So for example, we want to use the same font, the same font color, maybe a specific outline

110
0:07:53.640000 --> 0:07:54.840000
or something for a speaker.

111
0:07:54.840000 --> 0:08:01.760000
We can define that and then apply that always for that speaker.

112
0:08:01.760000 --> 0:08:04.920000
Now so much for captions.

113
0:08:04.920000 --> 0:08:09.480000
Now we move on to a little example on text descriptions.

114
0:08:09.480000 --> 0:08:20.320000
Here is one that I've used previously and we've got that as an example on the side.

115
0:08:20.320000 --> 0:08:21.760000
I'm not going to go there.

116
0:08:21.760000 --> 0:08:25.520000
I just want to mention it because we want to focus on captions today.

117
0:08:25.520000 --> 0:08:33.280000
But what happens here is we've got text that's aligned with start and end time as well.

118
0:08:33.280000 --> 0:08:41.560000
And for a typical word rate of a screen reader, it will fit into that space and it will be

119
0:08:41.560000 --> 0:08:48.440000
read back by the screen reader during that time.

120
0:08:49.440000 --> 0:08:52.720000
Here is the navigation example.

121
0:08:52.720000 --> 0:08:56.600000
As I mentioned, Web VTT can also be used for navigation.

122
0:08:56.600000 --> 0:09:03
Here we have three chapters and we can directly jump from chapter to chapter.

123
0:09:03 --> 0:09:07.840000
There needs to be extra controls on videos to support this but this is something we're

124
0:09:07.840000 --> 0:09:11.080000
working towards.

125
0:09:11.080000 --> 0:09:17
Now of course, as I'm saying, controls and input into web pages and automatic rendering,

126
0:09:17 --> 0:09:19.120000
we need to know how we're going to do that.

127
0:09:19.120000 --> 0:09:29
And there is markup in HTML5 for associating captions and formats like this with videos.

128
0:09:29 --> 0:09:35.960000
In this example, I've got all of the VTT files that we've used before.

129
0:09:35.960000 --> 0:09:41.560000
I've included them here and what we're using for it is called a track element.

130
0:09:41.560000 --> 0:09:48
And this track element is included underneath the video element in the HTML5 markup.

131
0:09:48 --> 0:09:55.240000
It links to the VTT file and there is some description possible for the type of file

132
0:09:55.240000 --> 0:09:56.240000
it is.

133
0:09:56.240000 --> 0:09:57.880000
So we have a label.

134
0:09:57.880000 --> 0:10:00.200000
In this case, it's an English caption.

135
0:10:00.200000 --> 0:10:10.560000
We have a kind which gives us a means to group all the tracks of the same type together.

136
0:10:10.560000 --> 0:10:15.760000
And we identify the language because of course when we have user settings in browsers, we

137
0:10:15.760000 --> 0:10:22.120000
want to automatically make certain tracks available to the user.

138
0:10:22.120000 --> 0:10:27.160000
If the user has, for example, said that they always want captions or they always want subtitles

139
0:10:27.160000 --> 0:10:29.120000
in their language being shown.

140
0:10:29.120000 --> 0:10:35.880000
So the browser can look through this markup and identify which ones it has to turn on by

141
0:10:35.880000 --> 0:10:38.280000
default.

142
0:10:38.360000 --> 0:10:42.360000
Now in this case, I've used only Web VTT files.

143
0:10:42.360000 --> 0:10:50
The track layout, the way that we've defined track in HTML5 is actually generic.

144
0:10:50 --> 0:10:54.520000
It can be used for other types of files as well.

145
0:10:54.520000 --> 0:11:02.280000
TTML or SRT or any other formats that will be implemented.

146
0:11:02.360000 --> 0:11:11.200000
But the generic way that track works is in this way.

147
0:11:11.200000 --> 0:11:16.200000
Now once we've got it in the browser, we can actually support more than what is directly

148
0:11:16.200000 --> 0:11:19.800000
impossible as markup in the Web VTT file.

149
0:11:19.800000 --> 0:11:24.280000
Because now we've got the text in the browser and we can make use of all the functionality

150
0:11:24.280000 --> 0:11:32.040000
of the browser which has styling and the concurrent style sheet functionality available to it.

151
0:11:32.040000 --> 0:11:40.800000
So this kind of styling is also available if used in a browser to these queues.

152
0:11:40.800000 --> 0:11:48.760000
And the way in which this is being done is that there is a pseudo element in CSS called

153
0:11:48.760000 --> 0:11:51.240000
colon colon queue.

154
0:11:51.240000 --> 0:12:00.200000
And with that, pseudo element you can address, for example, classes in the queue markup and

155
0:12:00.200000 --> 0:12:06.480000
you can override the formatting that by default would be given.

156
0:12:06.480000 --> 0:12:12.320000
You can, for example, well in this case it's been turned red, uppercase, a different font

157
0:12:12.320000 --> 0:12:19.400000
family and a lighter weight.

158
0:12:19.400000 --> 0:12:20.600000
Now we've spoken a lot.

159
0:12:20.600000 --> 0:12:22.480000
We want to see a little bit of a demo here.

160
0:12:22.480000 --> 0:12:28.600000
And I've made a little bit of a demo which shows that we can do more than what's typically

161
0:12:28.600000 --> 0:12:30.480000
being used for captions right now.

162
0:12:30.480000 --> 0:12:36.080000
Most captions that are being used are pop-on captions which are captions that don't overlap

163
0:12:36.080000 --> 0:12:37.080000
in time.

164
0:12:37.080000 --> 0:12:40.040000
There's one piece of caption, one queue shown.

165
0:12:40.040000 --> 0:12:42.080000
It disappears and the next queue is brought up.

166
0:12:42.080000 --> 0:12:44.240000
That's pop-on.

167
0:12:44.240000 --> 0:12:47.920000
And that is the default way of rendering it.

168
0:12:47.920000 --> 0:12:55.200000
But we may have a very different style of providing captions as well which is traditionally

169
0:12:55.200000 --> 0:12:59.240000
been used mostly in live captioning.

170
0:12:59.240000 --> 0:13:00.680000
It's called roll up.

171
0:13:00.680000 --> 0:13:08.160000
So the queues will actually be added at the bottom and roll up and the old ones will disappear.

172
0:13:08.160000 --> 0:13:11.920000
So I've made a little example that shows how that can be done as well.

173
0:13:11.920000 --> 0:13:13.600000
Let's hope this works.

174
0:13:13.600000 --> 0:13:18.200000
I've heard about the Sargino project and I saw it online and I said, well, a lot of

175
0:13:18.200000 --> 0:13:20.040000
people are starting to talk about this.

176
0:13:20.040000 --> 0:13:21.440000
I should check it out.

177
0:13:21.440000 --> 0:13:27.760000
Because we wanted to make a tool for our students that was more modern, that was available

178
0:13:27.760000 --> 0:13:31.560000
on the market at the moment.

179
0:13:31.560000 --> 0:13:36
For me it was a case that this is a tool that I could see using myself and therefore

180
0:13:36 --> 0:13:39.400000
I could believe in actually helping me to get out to a wider world.

181
0:13:39.400000 --> 0:13:51.280000
So you could see that the captions were being pushed up.

182
0:13:51.360000 --> 0:14:06.080000
As they were being displayed, this is a very simple way of doing this kind of roll up.

183
0:14:06.080000 --> 0:14:10.680000
So as we're moving on, the next caption gets added to the bottom.

184
0:14:10.680000 --> 0:14:13.680000
This can be improved.

185
0:14:13.680000 --> 0:14:15.120000
This is just a very crude demo.

186
0:14:15.120000 --> 0:14:18.520000
But this can be improved with a bit more CSS in the browser.

187
0:14:18.520000 --> 0:14:25.680000
We can, for example, transition the text more slowly and then it would be more readable

188
0:14:25.680000 --> 0:14:28.040000
rather than it jumping there directly.

189
0:14:28.040000 --> 0:14:33.280000
There's a whole swag of CSS functionality available to us in the browser to make this

190
0:14:33.280000 --> 0:14:35.480000
look very nice.

191
0:14:35.480000 --> 0:14:42.760000
And the functionality is there and possible to be used.

192
0:14:42.760000 --> 0:14:47.560000
I've mentioned PaintOn and RollUp captions.

193
0:14:47.560000 --> 0:14:50.400000
I've mentioned PopOn and RollUp captions.

194
0:14:50.400000 --> 0:14:55.360000
I want to briefly also mention PaintOn captions even though that's a bit more of an exotic

195
0:14:55.360000 --> 0:14:56.360000
use case.

196
0:14:56.360000 --> 0:15:01.040000
But it's possible to be used in C8 captions.

197
0:15:01.040000 --> 0:15:06.840000
So we need to make sure that it's also possible to be represented in Web VTT.

198
0:15:06.840000 --> 0:15:13.120000
And what we've introduced for this kind of application is queue time stems.

199
0:15:13.120000 --> 0:15:19.440000
These queue time stems are basically just a time stem that is being included into the

200
0:15:19.440000 --> 0:15:27.440000
text and says when the text that comes afterwards will be activated.

201
0:15:27.440000 --> 0:15:31.440000
Here I've done it, pardon me, at the word level.

202
0:15:31.440000 --> 0:15:36.680000
I've put queue time stems in for every word.

203
0:15:36.680000 --> 0:15:40.200000
So every word would come up one after the other on the screen.

204
0:15:41.200000 --> 0:15:42.680000
However, the resolution is arbitrary.

205
0:15:42.680000 --> 0:15:47.640000
We could do that on every character if necessary.

206
0:15:47.640000 --> 0:15:55.800000
Interestingly enough, that can also be used for styling through CSS.

207
0:15:55.800000 --> 0:16:00.480000
There are the past and future pseudo selectors.

208
0:16:00.480000 --> 0:16:07.080000
And these selectors allow us, for example, to do something like Paint the old text in

209
0:16:07.080000 --> 0:16:12.360000
yellow, the new text in white with the text shadow.

210
0:16:12.360000 --> 0:16:15
And as it goes over, everything goes yellow.

211
0:16:15 --> 0:16:22.800000
And we know this kind of application, obviously, from Caroque, which bridges into these applications

212
0:16:22.800000 --> 0:16:27.880000
as well, into more modern timeline text applications.

213
0:16:27.880000 --> 0:16:34.440000
We can cover all of these use cases with the same approach.

214
0:16:34.440000 --> 0:16:38.360000
So that brings me to the end of the presentation.

215
0:16:38.360000 --> 0:16:46.600000
We regard Web VTT as a bridge between broadcast and the web of the future.

216
0:16:46.600000 --> 0:16:54.040000
We can support all of the C8608 captions, all of the features, possibly also some of the

217
0:16:54.040000 --> 0:16:57.480000
708 features.

218
0:16:57.480000 --> 0:17:01.920000
I think most of them, I haven't analyzed in detail, but most of the 708 features will

219
0:17:01.920000 --> 0:17:04.160000
be supported as well.

220
0:17:04.160000 --> 0:17:08.480000
It's a simplicity of editing, which we like about the Web VTT format.

221
0:17:08.480000 --> 0:17:09.480000
It's readable.

222
0:17:09.480000 --> 0:17:10.920000
You can read it here on screen.

223
0:17:10.920000 --> 0:17:16
There's not too much busyness as you're looking at it.

224
0:17:16 --> 0:17:20.160000
And that means also that it's easy to edit and to create.

225
0:17:20.160000 --> 0:17:24.560000
We have the ability to apply web styling through the mechanism, the track mechanism that has

226
0:17:24.560000 --> 0:17:27.840000
been included into HTML5.

227
0:17:27.840000 --> 0:17:31.560000
And this is an open and freely available format.

228
0:17:31.560000 --> 0:17:36.640000
And if you're looking for references, I've put the references on this last slide to all

229
0:17:36.640000 --> 0:17:38.760000
the specs, they're available for free.

230
0:17:38.760000 --> 0:17:41.560000
Thank you very much.

231
0:17:41.560000 --> 0:17:46.920000
So thank you, Sylvia.

232
0:17:46.920000 --> 0:17:48.160000
We have a mic up.

233
0:17:48.160000 --> 0:17:51.960000
If people want to ask any questions, maybe you could introduce yourself briefly.

234
0:17:51.960000 --> 0:17:54.480000
We're recording this and we're going to be posting it to YouTube.

235
0:17:54.480000 --> 0:17:57.960000
So hopefully you won't be shy, but please, if you have any questions for Sylvia about

236
0:17:57.960000 --> 0:18:01.880000
the Web VTT, please step up to the mic.

237
0:18:01.880000 --> 0:18:03.400000
I was going very quickly.

238
0:18:03.400000 --> 0:18:08.040000
So if somebody wants to go back and explore any of the features in more detail, this is

239
0:18:08.040000 --> 0:18:09.800000
probably the opportunity.

240
0:18:09.800000 --> 0:18:12.880000
Hi, I'm Daniel Steinberg at Google.

241
0:18:12.880000 --> 0:18:14.320000
A couple of questions.

242
0:18:14.320000 --> 0:18:19.880000
When you had the line number specification, how does that apply when you have vertical

243
0:18:19.880000 --> 0:18:23.160000
text?

244
0:18:23.160000 --> 0:18:25.720000
Let me just find that.

245
0:18:25.720000 --> 0:18:26.720000
Here's this one.

246
0:18:26.720000 --> 0:18:27.720000
Yeah.

247
0:18:28.360000 --> 0:18:36.040000
Line numbers are basically done for horizontal text, obviously, from the top to the bottom.

248
0:18:36.040000 --> 0:18:39.640000
And for vertical text, they are turned around.

249
0:18:39.640000 --> 0:18:43
So they apply in the same way.

250
0:18:43 --> 0:18:50.520000
And you have a lot of the underpinnings for interactive tags, but not the actual.

251
0:18:50.520000 --> 0:18:52.440000
I didn't see anything actually there.

252
0:18:52.440000 --> 0:18:57.840000
So the ability to say this particular tag is live and clicking on it might give a link

253
0:18:57.840000 --> 0:19:02
or something like that if you consider interactivity.

254
0:19:02 --> 0:19:06.960000
Interactivity, you particularly talking about hyperlinks in this case?

255
0:19:06.960000 --> 0:19:07.960000
In this case, yes.

256
0:19:07.960000 --> 0:19:08.960000
Yes.

257
0:19:08.960000 --> 0:19:12.320000
So hyperlinks is something of a bit of a controversial issue.

258
0:19:12.320000 --> 0:19:14.440000
We've discussed this.

259
0:19:14.440000 --> 0:19:17.520000
It is obviously something that can easily be added.

260
0:19:17.520000 --> 0:19:19.320000
We've got the markup in HTML5.

261
0:19:19.320000 --> 0:19:25.480000
We could easily put a tag in there and hyperlink.

262
0:19:25.480000 --> 0:19:32.720000
It's not something that's currently part of the specification simply because people don't

263
0:19:32.720000 --> 0:19:34.760000
believe that it's a very good experience.

264
0:19:34.760000 --> 0:19:38.120000
When you're watching captions, they stay on the screen only for a very short amount of

265
0:19:38.120000 --> 0:19:39.120000
time.

266
0:19:39.120000 --> 0:19:42.520000
By the time you've decided that you want to follow a link, it's already gone.

267
0:19:42.520000 --> 0:19:43.680000
That's the reason.

268
0:19:43.680000 --> 0:19:47.240000
So I'm obviously not fully subscribed to that reason.

269
0:19:47.240000 --> 0:19:51.640000
I would actually like to have hyperlinks in it as well.

270
0:19:51.640000 --> 0:19:55.160000
What I look at in this format is that it's easy to extend it.

271
0:19:55.160000 --> 0:20:01.720000
And if somebody was to support it, then it is not a problem to put that in as well.

272
0:20:01.720000 --> 0:20:02.720000
Yes.

273
0:20:02.720000 --> 0:20:06.360000
Something to consider with the hyperlinks is that because you have the ability to author

274
0:20:06.360000 --> 0:20:11.800000
different kinds of files, you could have a description that had a longer time and had

275
0:20:11.800000 --> 0:20:12.800000
a longer duration.

276
0:20:12.800000 --> 0:20:17.480000
You wouldn't have to disappear when a caption line disappeared.

277
0:20:17.480000 --> 0:20:21.360000
In fact, I should actually add something.

278
0:20:21.360000 --> 0:20:28.120000
As I mentioned, we've got kinds of text that we're expecting in a Web VTT file.

279
0:20:28.120000 --> 0:20:30.160000
I've talked about captions and subtitles.

280
0:20:30.160000 --> 0:20:32.120000
I've talked about text descriptions.

281
0:20:32.120000 --> 0:20:33.480000
And I've talked about navigation.

282
0:20:33.480000 --> 0:20:38.480000
I've only mentioned metadata, but metadata actually solves that problem.

283
0:20:38.480000 --> 0:20:43.240000
Data means that you're allowed to put anything into a queue.

284
0:20:43.240000 --> 0:20:48.360000
Any markup you want, any non markup you want, any text, anything at all.

285
0:20:48.360000 --> 0:20:52.160000
It just means that the browser can't do anything with it.

286
0:20:52.160000 --> 0:20:56.080000
It sees that it's of the kind metadata and goes, I'm being hands off.

287
0:20:56.080000 --> 0:21:00.480000
I'm just going to hand it onto the JavaScript and the JavaScript can do with it whatever

288
0:21:00.480000 --> 0:21:01.480000
it likes.

289
0:21:01.480000 --> 0:21:04
So this would be one way to have interactivity in it.

290
0:21:04 --> 0:21:10.880000
You could just grab it through JavaScript and then put it into a div on your page.

291
0:21:10.880000 --> 0:21:14.240000
And then there would be a hyperlink.

292
0:21:14.240000 --> 0:21:18.400000
And anything else that you can come up with that's time aligned would work in this similar

293
0:21:18.400000 --> 0:21:20.200000
way as well.

294
0:21:20.200000 --> 0:21:21.240000
And one last question.

295
0:21:21.240000 --> 0:21:26.600000
You showed the different formats, captions and descriptions and whatnot, as essentially

296
0:21:26.600000 --> 0:21:33.640000
the same VTT format distinguished only by the track tag.

297
0:21:33.640000 --> 0:21:40.640000
And I wonder if there's enough semantic difference that you'd want to be able to distinguish

298
0:21:40.640000 --> 0:21:41.640000
it in another way.

299
0:21:41.640000 --> 0:21:50.600000
Like for instance, could you build a file that had captions and descriptions in it?

300
0:21:50.600000 --> 0:21:54.880000
Or might you want to have some identifier in the file say this is a description file rather

301
0:21:54.880000 --> 0:21:59.400000
than count on the track tag?

302
0:21:59.400000 --> 0:22:05.440000
Using content in one track is of course possible.

303
0:22:05.440000 --> 0:22:15.960000
You could concatenate a caption file with an audio description file then you would basically

304
0:22:15.960000 --> 0:22:20.040000
have two tracks available through one file.

305
0:22:20.040000 --> 0:22:28.040000
It's not a very easy way to deal with and it would require a lot of additional implementation.

306
0:22:28.040000 --> 0:22:34.880000
So for example, if that concatenated case was to be handled, the browsers would need

307
0:22:34.880000 --> 0:22:38.200000
to find out where the second file starts and so on.

308
0:22:38.200000 --> 0:22:45.640000
We actually like to keep the semantics separate and HTML markup is built on keeping semantics

309
0:22:45.640000 --> 0:22:46.640000
separate.

310
0:22:46.640000 --> 0:22:49.240000
So this is why we introduced the kind attribute.

311
0:22:49.240000 --> 0:22:57.280000
And so therefore in one file you will only find captions of one type.

312
0:22:57.280000 --> 0:22:58.280000
Thank you.

313
0:22:58.280000 --> 0:22:59.280000
Hi, Julia.

314
0:22:59.280000 --> 0:23:02.840000
John Folio from Sanford University.

315
0:23:02.840000 --> 0:23:07.720000
When you gave the code example of the CSS, it's not clear where the CSS actually lives.

316
0:23:07.720000 --> 0:23:11.200000
Is it embedded in the Web VTT file?

317
0:23:11.200000 --> 0:23:13.920000
Can you have an external file and link it?

318
0:23:13.920000 --> 0:23:16.080000
Can you just maybe get it that way?

319
0:23:16.080000 --> 0:23:18.920000
Yeah, but let me just find it.

320
0:23:18.920000 --> 0:23:20.320000
Sorry.

321
0:23:20.320000 --> 0:23:25.280000
So I deliberately just put that there as a snippet because it actually doesn't matter

322
0:23:25.280000 --> 0:23:27
where it lives.

323
0:23:27 --> 0:23:34.760000
At the moment, because we're doing the CSS through the HTML page that includes this

324
0:23:34.760000 --> 0:23:42.800000
file up there, that HTML page could either have this CSS piece directly in the HTML page

325
0:23:42.800000 --> 0:23:44.040000
and address it.

326
0:23:44.040000 --> 0:23:50.960000
So an in-band CSS or it could be in a CSS, an external CSS file and be pulled into the

327
0:23:50.960000 --> 0:23:54.880000
HTML page together with the Web VTT file.

328
0:23:54.880000 --> 0:23:56.360000
So it always sits outside of the HTML page?

329
0:23:56.360000 --> 0:23:57.360000
It can sit.

330
0:23:57.360000 --> 0:23:58.360000
Yeah.

331
0:23:58.360000 --> 0:24:02.440000
Well, so we're currently under discussion whether this is a functionality that we'd

332
0:24:02.440000 --> 0:24:04.520000
want to add to Web VTT as well.

333
0:24:04.520000 --> 0:24:14.280000
So whether you want a Web VTT file that links to a style sheet, we're careful about that

334
0:24:14.280000 --> 0:24:19.280000
because this comes from a very web point of view.

335
0:24:19.280000 --> 0:24:24.760000
We don't really want to pollute the Web VTT file with this Web functionality because there

336
0:24:24.760000 --> 0:24:30.120000
are applications outside the Web browser that do not want to have to implement, for

337
0:24:30.120000 --> 0:24:34.160000
example, all of CSS style sheets in order to display captions properly.

338
0:24:34.160000 --> 0:24:37.760000
So it probably makes more sense to have this as a separate file.

339
0:24:37.760000 --> 0:24:42.520000
And if people do want to have this additional functionality, they can use the Web VTT file

340
0:24:42.520000 --> 0:24:51.040000
and the CSS file together and parse them and use them in their style sheet engine to come

341
0:24:51.040000 --> 0:24:55.600000
up with a proper display.

342
0:24:55.600000 --> 0:24:59.400000
I actually have a practical example of why you would want the CSS business on.

343
0:24:59.400000 --> 0:25:00.400000
Can you hear me?

344
0:25:00.400000 --> 0:25:04.280000
I have a practical example of why you would want the CSS to be outside the VTT.

345
0:25:04.280000 --> 0:25:09.880000
I work currently with people who are producing caption files for the UK market and then redistributing

346
0:25:09.880000 --> 0:25:14.040000
that same video here in the US and they have to basically redo the entire caption file

347
0:25:14.040000 --> 0:25:19
because UK audiences are expecting, for instance, to see a particular speaker marked up in a

348
0:25:19.040000 --> 0:25:21.920000
particular color here in the US we're not expecting that.

349
0:25:21.920000 --> 0:25:26.720000
So you can imagine if you had one format where you marked up the content semantically that

350
0:25:26.720000 --> 0:25:31.920000
depending on whether you showed it in a player here for the US or there for the UK with the

351
0:25:31.920000 --> 0:25:37.360000
same caption file, you could display it differently according to different user's regional preferences.

352
0:25:37.360000 --> 0:25:42.560000
I would also add that user style sheets, the user could actually increase the font size

353
0:25:42.560000 --> 0:25:44.520000
to their specific requirements.

354
0:25:44.520000 --> 0:25:45.520000
Yes.

355
0:25:45.520000 --> 0:25:47.920000
I can really minor question on the alignment.

356
0:25:47.920000 --> 0:25:53.040000
You said it could be left, right or was it middle or center.

357
0:25:53.040000 --> 0:25:56.800000
Can you actually have it justified as well?

358
0:25:56.800000 --> 0:25:57.960000
No.

359
0:25:57.960000 --> 0:26:04.240000
I don't think we have a means to justify the text.

360
0:26:04.240000 --> 0:26:11.120000
But I also think that actually so from all the quality captions, literature that I've

361
0:26:11.200000 --> 0:26:19.640000
read how to do quality captions, I think justification has never been proposed as a readable way

362
0:26:19.640000 --> 0:26:25.640000
of doing it because it changes the spacing between characters and so therefore makes the text

363
0:26:25.640000 --> 0:26:27.200000
actually harder to read.

364
0:26:27.200000 --> 0:26:31.200000
I don't think we actually need that feature but it is a good point.

365
0:26:31.200000 --> 0:26:32.200000
Okay.

366
0:26:32.200000 --> 0:26:34.480000
Well, I just wasn't specifically declared one way or the other.

367
0:26:34.480000 --> 0:26:35.480000
I agree with you.

368
0:26:35.480000 --> 0:26:36.480000
Yeah.

369
0:26:36.480000 --> 0:26:37.480000
Okay.

370
0:26:37.480000 --> 0:26:38.480000
Fine.

371
0:26:38.480000 --> 0:26:39.480000
Excellent.

372
0:26:39.480000 --> 0:26:40.880000
Any more questions?

373
0:26:40.880000 --> 0:26:44.640000
Well, thank you very much.

374
0:26:44.640000 --> 0:26:50.320000
And I suppose if anyone has any more questions, we're always here to answer more questions.

375
0:26:50.320000 --> 0:26:56.880000
There's the accessibility group at Google through which now we can be reached.

376
0:26:56.880000 --> 0:26:59.920000
And I'm very active at the W3C.

377
0:26:59.920000 --> 0:27:02.840000
The feedback can be sent also to the What Working Group.

378
0:27:02.840000 --> 0:27:06.760000
There's plenty of ways to get to us.

379
0:27:06.760000 --> 0:27:10.240000
I should have probably put a contact slide in there as well.

380
0:27:10.240000 --> 0:27:12.560000
I'm also on Twitter and Facebook and so on.

381
0:27:12.560000 --> 0:27:14.600000
But just Google my name, Sylvia Ffeiffer.

382
0:27:14.600000 --> 0:27:15.600000
You'll find me.

383
0:27:15.600000 --> 0:27:16.280000
Thank you very much.
