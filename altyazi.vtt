0:00:00 --> 0:00:09
Our third finalist is Emily Johnston from the School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences.

2
0:00:09 --> 0:00:24.680000
Her presentation title is Mosquito Research, Saving Lives with Pantyhose and Paper Clips.

3
0:00:24.680000 --> 0:00:28.760000
I came to Australia to study the deadliest animal in the world.

4
0:00:28.760000 --> 0:00:31.360000
Now there may be some Australian audience members thinking,

5
0:00:31.360000 --> 0:00:37.480000
Struce, science has finally recognized the importance of the drop bears.

6
0:00:37.480000 --> 0:00:43.240000
But I'm not studying drop bears because around the world by transmitting diseases like malaria and dengue fever,

7
0:00:43.240000 --> 0:00:45.800000
mosquitoes kill more than a million people every year,

8
0:00:45.800000 --> 0:00:48.720000
making them the deadliest animal on the planet.

9
0:00:48.720000 --> 0:00:52.440000
Now in Australia the most common mosquito-borne disease is Ross River virus,

10
0:00:52.440000 --> 0:00:55.640000
and it occurs at high rates in some areas but not others.

11
0:00:55.640000 --> 0:00:56.960000
My question is why?

12
0:00:56.960000 --> 0:01:00.040000
What is it about certain areas that makes them breed disease?

13
0:01:00.040000 --> 0:01:04.200000
If we can understand the environmental factors that contribute to disease transmission,

14
0:01:04.200000 --> 0:01:09
then we can alter the environment or target our control efforts to prevent human infections.

15
0:01:09 --> 0:01:13.480000
But to answer that question, I had to find out where the infected mosquitoes were in South Australia,

16
0:01:13.480000 --> 0:01:17.320000
and traditionally testing mosquitoes for virus has always been difficult.

17
0:01:17.320000 --> 0:01:18.920000
So I used a new technique.

18
0:01:18.920000 --> 0:01:22.840000
It takes these cards, which are embedded with virus-preserving chemicals,

19
0:01:22.840000 --> 0:01:24.520000
and coats them in honey.

20
0:01:24.520000 --> 0:01:26.240000
The mosquitoes will come to feed on the honey,

21
0:01:26.240000 --> 0:01:30.400000
and in the process spit virus onto the card where it can later be detected.

22
0:01:30.400000 --> 0:01:33.760000
Now no one had ever used this technique in a broad-scale virus survey before,

23
0:01:33.760000 --> 0:01:35.400000
so I had to adapt it.

24
0:01:35.400000 --> 0:01:40.440000
I developed new traps and set them at over 100 field sites across South Australia.

25
0:01:40.440000 --> 0:01:44.560000
Then I captured over 20,000 hungry mosquitoes and let them feed on the card for a week

26
0:01:44.560000 --> 0:01:47.040000
before testing the cards for a virus.

27
0:01:47.040000 --> 0:01:49.720000
Now you may not think that these traps look very impressive,

28
0:01:49.720000 --> 0:01:51.640000
but science doesn't have to be beautiful.

29
0:01:51.640000 --> 0:01:53
It has to be effective,

30
0:01:53 --> 0:01:57.440000
and these traps are proving to be our most sensitive method of detecting infected mosquitoes.

31
0:01:57.440000 --> 0:01:59.120000
I found three types of infection,

32
0:01:59.120000 --> 0:02:02.520000
Ross River virus, Barma Forest virus, and Stratford virus,

33
0:02:02.520000 --> 0:02:05.320000
which has never before been found in South Australia.

34
0:02:05.320000 --> 0:02:08.520000
I now have the virus data I need to conduct my analysis,

35
0:02:08.520000 --> 0:02:12.960000
and I'm collecting publicly available data about the environment surrounding my traps,

36
0:02:12.960000 --> 0:02:16.280000
like the density of human housing, the biodiversity of mammals,

37
0:02:16.280000 --> 0:02:18.480000
and the ratio of green space to buildings,

38
0:02:18.480000 --> 0:02:21.720000
to see if any of those environmental factors can link

39
0:02:21.720000 --> 0:02:24.760000
these virus hotspots that I've shown here.

40
0:02:24.760000 --> 0:02:28.760000
But the most exciting part of my research so far has been the success of this method.

41
0:02:28.760000 --> 0:02:31.840000
Public health officials in Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia

42
0:02:31.840000 --> 0:02:36.640000
have been in contact with us about implementing this technique for their surveillance next year.

43
0:02:36.640000 --> 0:02:38.680000
And I developed these traps in a tight budget.

44
0:02:38.680000 --> 0:02:42.560000
I used recycled milk cartons, pantyhose and paperclips to make the traps.

45
0:02:42.560000 --> 0:02:46.200000
Each trap costs less than a dollar and can be reused for the whole season.

46
0:02:46.200000 --> 0:02:49.480000
That was important to me because the majority of mosquito-borne disease risk

47
0:02:49.480000 --> 0:02:51.920000
happens in economically impoverished countries.

48
0:02:51.920000 --> 0:02:56.080000
In India, for example, where about a quarter of the population lives on a dollar a day,

49
0:02:56.080000 --> 0:02:59.880000
there are 33 million cases of dengue infection every year.

50
0:02:59.880000 --> 0:03:03.200000
With my low-budget virus surveillance and spatial analysis method,

51
0:03:03.200000 --> 0:03:05.680000
I can help any country, regardless of resources,

52
0:03:05.680000 --> 0:03:07.960000
find out where their deadliest animals occur,

53
0:03:07.960000 --> 0:03:11.360000
why they're there, and how we can stop them from infecting humans.

54
0:03:11.360000 --> 0:03:12.360000
Thanks.
